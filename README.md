"# find-falcon" 
This is a Find Falcon Project. In this project, I have completed below mentioned points.
Some instructions can be found here: https://geektrust.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/v2/website/coding-challenges/Geektrust-UI-Problems1.pdf

1. I have used REST Api to fetch data and inject that data into DOM, also considering dropdown menu selection.
2. I have used memory such as array to store the updated data planets and vehicles.
3. I have used bootstrap for UI.
4. There are some conditional rendering based on user input such as checked input and dropdown selection.
5. I have used localstorage to render data after successfull response from api.
